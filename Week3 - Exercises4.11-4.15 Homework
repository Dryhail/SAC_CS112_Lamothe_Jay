Homework:
Exercise 4.11 to 4.15
Bonus: Build a calculator by unconditional add/substract
mulitiply/devide by 2 numbers



4.11 - Explain what happens when you divide 2 integers?
 - If there is a remainder or fractional part, it is deleted or rounded off automatically.  
- To get the remainder, you may use a remainder % operator.
- You may avoid the outcome by making the answer a double.

4.12 - What are 2 ways of combining control statemetns?
 - Control statements can either be stacked or nested!

4.13 - What type of repetition would be appropriate for calculating the sum of the first 100 positive
integers?
 - While

 What type would be appropriate for calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive integers? 
 -  While loop with a sentinel
  
 Briefly describe how each of these tasks could be performed. 
 
 1) int ctr = 1; sum =0;
while (ctr<=100) {
    sum = sum + ctr;
    ctr++;
}

2) int ctr = 1; sum =0;
while ((num =ctr.nextInt() x<0) {
    sum = sum + ctr;
    ctr++;
}
